<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Short Peripheral Intravenous Catheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ported Short PIVC</li><li>Non-Ported Short PIVC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Short Peripheral Intravenous Catheter (PIVC) market is primarily categorized into ported and non-ported types. Ported short PIVCs include an additional access port, allowing for the administration of medications without needing to replace the entire catheter, thus reducing the risk of complications. Non-ported short PIVCs, on the other hand, lack this feature and require direct access for every medication administration, which may increase the frequency of catheter replacements. Both types serve critical roles in intravenous therapies within clinical settings.</p></p>
