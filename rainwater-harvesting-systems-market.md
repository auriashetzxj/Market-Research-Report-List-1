<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rainwater Harvesting Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Roof Rainwater Collection</li><li>Surface Rainwater Collection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rainwater harvesting systems are classified into two main market types: roof rainwater collection and surface rainwater collection. Roof rainwater collection involves capturing precipitation directly from rooftops using gutters and downspouts, typically stored in tanks for later use. This method is efficient for residential and commercial applications. Surface rainwater collection, on the other hand, gathers water from land surfaces like pavements and fields, often utilizing swales and basins, making it suitable for larger landscapes and agricultural uses. Both systems promote sustainable water management.</p></p>
